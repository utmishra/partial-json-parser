# Partial JSON Parser
Partial JSON Parser, written in Python to stream JSON responses from LLMs

**Note**
- This is a experimental purposes only and currently in development. For production use, prefer existing packages like [partial-json-parser]([url](https://pypi.org/project/partial-json-parser/))
- Currently supports only String & Objects. I will be working on supporting all types soon

**Demo**
- Streaming large JSON response iteratively: [Repl.it]([url](https://replit.com/@utmishra1/Partial-JSON-Streaming-Parser-for-LLM-Demo))
  - The front-end files are AI-generated, not efficient and for demo purposes only
