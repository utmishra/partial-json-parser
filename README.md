# Partial JSON Parser
Partial JSON Parser, written in Python to stream JSON responses from LLMs

**Note**
- This is a experimental purposes only and currently in development. For production use, prefer existing packages like [partial-json-parser]([url](https://pypi.org/project/partial-json-parser/))
- Currently supports only String & Objects. I will be working on supporting all types soon
